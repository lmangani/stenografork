$0 provides a simple method for reading logs out of stenographer.
Its first argument is the query to send to stenographer, all other arguments
are passed to TCPDump.

Examples:
 # Print all packets for source IP 1.1.1.1 without DNS resolution (-n).
 $0 'host 1.1.1.1' -n src host 1.1.1.1
 # Print all PSH packets between 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2:
 $0 'host 1.1.1.1 and host 2.2.2.2' -n 'tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-push != 0'
 # Write all packets between 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2 to disk.
'host 1.1.1.1 and host 2.2.2.2' -w /tmp/out.pcap

See README.md for more details on the Stenographer query language.

Set the STENOGRAPHER_CONFIG environmental variable to point to your stenographer
config if it's in a nonstandard place (defaults to /etc/stenographer/config).
