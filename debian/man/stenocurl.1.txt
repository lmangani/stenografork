NAME
  stenocurl - curl wrapper to access Stenographer URLs

SYNOPSIS
  stenocurl /<path> [curl args...]

DESCRIPTION
  Runs 'curl' against https://stenographerserver/path, returning data on STDOUT.
  Any arguments after the first are passed directly to 'curl'.

  This script is mostly used to access /debug/XXX URLs for Stenographer... for
  accessing packets, it's probably better to use the 'stenoread' wrapper around
  this script, which correctly passes packet requests into steno, then passes
  the results through tcpdump for easier handling.

OPTIONS
  This tool forwards its arguments to curl.
